aggregate(data$shopping_PT~data$customer_ID, data=df, max)
where 'data' = your name for the dataset in R

then -

merge(aggregate(data$shopping_PT~data$customer_ID, data=df, max),df,all.x=T)

Darrel Dent: Okay.  I looked at the aggregate function, but I couldn't figure out a way to apply it.  What does the all.x=T function in the merge do?

Travis: keeps the other columns with data relevant to the max point
Travis: so all the other data gets kept and brought along. otherwise you only get the output of the cust ID and the max shopping PT
